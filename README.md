# Effin' Date 
jquery/html/css/angular/chrome extension practice.

I created this initially as a chrome extension, but thought it too vulgar to add to my portfolio. Instead, I published it here! 

#What does it do? 
The background changes color on load, there's funky particle effects, and the greeting changes by time of day (morning, afternoon, night). The correct date shows and you're able to add a to-do to the last sentence.
